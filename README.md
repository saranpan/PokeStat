# PokeStat Estimator
Are you tired of struggling to estimate the stats (HP, Atk, Def, spAtk, spDef, Speed) 
of new generation Pokemon or even your own fan-made Pokemon based on their appearance? We believe 
that appearance plays a significant role in estimating a Pokemon's stats, and our machine learning 
model has been trained to recognize this pattern from the perspective of GameFreak. For example, 
Pokemon with a chubby appearance (e.g. Wailord, Chansey, Snorlax) tend to have high HP, while those 
with a bit of steel tend to have high Def or spDef.

We created this application to help make this process easier. By using machine learning, 
we trained our model to learn the pattern of a Pokemon's appearance and fit it to the stats of each
official Pokemon as accurately as possible. To use it, simply input a JPG image of the Pokemon and 
the model will return an estimation of its stats. Don't let appearance be the only factor in your estimations â€“ 
try out our application and see how it can improve your predictions using the perspective of GameFreak
